> **Organization** - Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) <br> <br>

> **Description** - Every year more than 6 crores of Indians graduates from diverse backgrounds and with diversity in education. Almost similar number of students enter into colleges for taking various education to help them in seeking jobs. The task to track students on a one on one basis is also hectic due to the huge number. AICTE and MHRD aims to track students and colleges to hlp them in various processes like ease of student identification, ease of AICTE approved college tracking, ease in distribution of fellowships, grants, training. Since there is no one unique identification of students the process itself takes time as it requires to have letters from college heads which is also time taking process. Hence to track the huge number manually is hectic and a time taking process. <br> <br>
